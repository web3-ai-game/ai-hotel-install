## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing code formatting
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add comments for complex logic

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Update the documentation with any new features
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of maintainers
